<h3>What is Sockenote?</h3> 
Sockenote is an web application that allows user to draw on top of live camera feed. It includes multiple drawing features, such as a color wheel, and brush size module. When the user finishes their augmented drawing, they can share the result on the twitter

<h3> Why did I make this?????? </h3>

When working on a basic project (to more learn the basics about the program). I thought about the snapchat feature of being able to draw on faces, and other objects. This made me wonder If I could be able to do the same thing, but with other apps. It was made more to challenge myself, as well as figure out in greater detail how the language works.

<h3> Process/OHHH MY GOOOD WHY IS NOTHNG WORKING!!! </h3>


The basic process started with me (and a mentor) trying to figure out how to apply live video to a page. We soon after a while found the Canvas function. This function is very good because it allowed us to have two layers. One where the video streams, and another where you draw on top of. This allowed me to focus more on the color wheel. Due to the fact I am not a very artistic (and frankly not that advanced when it comes to code, I took someone’s basic concept for the color wheel. The link to that would be found here 
(http://acko.net/blog/farbtastic-jquery-color-picker-plug-in/)
After a while We created a top part, and implemented the color wheel into the top part. After that I worked more on cleaning the page up, so it looks better. Beforehand it was two screens. One for video recording, and one for drawing. There was also not very clean button placement. I spent the next moment completely upgrading it to what you see it as today. I was going to upgrade the art at the top of the bar, but I’m bias to the crappy MS paint designs. After this I worked on brush size, and attaching it to a twitter account. At first i was going to use some random application that transmitted information from one social media to another, but it seemed to be cleaner if we just used the twitter developer kit. This aroused some new bugs, and these were taken care of. After this instillation I did a tiny bit of things here and there, but not enough to warrant mention. I at first wanted to do more, but now my focus is on other projects.

<h3>What I learned from Sockenote </h3>

Throughout the slow creation of sockenote I have learned many things. First off I learned a basic understanding of how css/Javascript/html work. I also learned how to integrate other people’s code into my own project. Explicitly for lines I knew nothing about. 

<h3> What is the next step </h3>

The next step I can either go two ways. I can continue to work on sockenote (and make it cross platform), this would expand my knowledge on the code even more, and soon make it so that the person can upload their images to their own account, this way everyone can see it. The other step is I can work on other projects. This is what most likely what I will do. I am already now working on 2 projects called autolight, and nesboy. Maybe someday I would go back to this but it was a good base to start from.
